## Installation

To add a specific version, you can use `yarn add gumdrops@1.0.0` (replace 1.0.0 with whatever version you want, or omit it to get the latest version)

The current and previous versions can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/gumgum/gumdrops/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Design System
There are two ways to use GumGum's Design System:

#### 1. NPM package (preferred)

Add [gumgum-design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gumgum-design) and [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) to your project:

Note: [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) has been deprecated.

```
yarn add gumgum-design sass
```

Create and import your main Sass file in main App component:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './main.scss';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (...);
    }
}

export default App;
```

In main.scss, import the theme first to declare all color variables:

```scss
import '~gumgum-design/styles/scss/index';
```

The theme file contains variables for every color used in Design System, along with 5 shades darker and lighter of each color.
The prime slots defines theme-specific colors, while the component slots defines component-specific colors.


#### 2. Link to CSS

Include one of the available CSS theme files in the `<head>` of your HTML document:

Note: This links to old Design System and will no longer receive updates.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://assets.ggops.com/stable/theme-blue.css">
```

[See the Design System documentation](https://ds.gumgum.com/stable/md/docs/index.html) for themes, CSS utilities and more.
