### Concrete Design System

Gumdrops must be used with the GumGum Design System (Concrete), which handles all of the styles.

Add [gumgum-design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gumgum-design) and [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) to your project:

Note: [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) has been deprecated.

```
yarn add gumgum-design sass
```

Create and import your main Sass file in main App component:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './main.scss';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (...);
    }
}

export default App;
```

In main.scss, import the theme first to declare all color variables:

```scss
import '~gumgum-design/styles/scss/index';
```

The theme file contains variables for every color used in Design System, along with 5 shades darker and lighter of each color.
The prime slots defines theme-specific colors, while the component slots defines component-specific colors.

[See the Concrete Design System documentation](https://concrete.gumgum.com) for design system specific documentation.
