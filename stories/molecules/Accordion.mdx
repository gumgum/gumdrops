# Accordion

The `<Accordion>` component is a collapsible container for holding related elements. Nest `<AccordionItem>` components inside `<Accordion>` for each drawer. Nest `<AccordionItemContent>` in each `<AccordionItem>` if you would like to display listed information within an open `<AccordionItem>`. Each `<Accordion>` related component accepts a className and otherProps so you are able to further customize the component.

## Examples

You can use `<Accordion>` to display any information that you pass in, such as:

```jsx
<Accordion>
    <AccordionItem label="Controls">
        <FormGroup>
            <FormGroupLabel text="Name" />
            <TextInput name="name" />
        </FormGroup>
    </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

You can also use `<Accordion>` to display information in a list form, in the case you want to list items in rows. Example:

```jsx
<Accordion>
    <AccordionItem label="Settings">
        <AccordionItemContent>
            <Column md="6">
                Setting 1
            </Column>
            <Column md=6>
                <Button>Save</Button>
            </Column>
        </AccordionItemContent>
        <AccordionItemContent>
            <Column md="6">
                Setting 2
            </Column>
            <Column md=6>
                <Button>Save</Button>
            </Column>
        </AccordionItemContent>
    </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```
