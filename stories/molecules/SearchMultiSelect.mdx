# SearchMultiSelect

The `<SearchMultiSelect>` is similar to the `<MultiSelect>` component, but it is tailored for situations where there are way too many options that the `<MultiSelect>` becomes impractical.

As the name suggests, the `<SearchMultiSelect>` comes with a case insensitive term matching, and a small tag indicator to show you how many options were selected, as well a small balloon where you can quickly see what options you have selected so far.

## Full Example

```jsx
const [names, setNames] = useState(initialNames);
const _handleInputChange = value => autocompleteRequest(value); // your autocomplete function

return (
    <FormGroup>
        <FormGroupLabel text="names" />
        <SearchMultiSelect
            placeholder="some placeholder text"
            options={names}
            update={newNames => setNames(newNames)}
            onChange={_handleInputChange}
            context="primary"
            size="sm"
            multiTerm
            searchKeys
            termDivider="-"
        />
    </FormGroup>
);
```

## Options

The format of the options must be an array of objects that contains at least three properties: `name`, `isSelected`, and `key`.

| property   | description                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| name       | the text displayed on the dropdown                        |
| isSelected | boolean that determines if the option is selected or not  |
| key        | uniquely identifies each options (key must be \`unique\`) |

```
[
    {
        name: 'Jose Santos',
        isSelected: true,
        key: 0
    },
    ...
]
```

## Keybindings

| key   | description                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| enter | toggles the currently highlighted option |
| up    | highlights the previous options          |
| down  | highlights the next option               |
| esc   | closes the dropdown                      |
