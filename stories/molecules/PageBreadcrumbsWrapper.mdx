# PagesBreadcrumbsWrapper

**NOTE**: This is a newer component of previous/deprecated breadcrumbs. These breadcrumbs are designed to be used at the page level and not in header. These are new classnames as well.

**See the `<PageBreadcrumbs/>` component for an opinionated plug and play version**

The `<PageBreadcrumbsWrapper>` component helps when you need more customization than what the `<PageBreadcrumbs/>` component provides, use it together with the `<PageBreadcrumb>` and `<PageBreadcrumbLink>` component to get the desired styles or pass your own.

## Full Example

Create a custom array of breadcrumbs and pass it to the component:

```jsx
const breadcrumbs = [
    {
        title: 'Home',
        to: '/'
    },
    {
        title: 'Publishers',
        to: '/publishers'
    },
    {
        title: 'Some Publisher',
        to: '/publishers/123'
    },
    {
        title: 'Random Page',
        to: '/random-route/123'
    }
];

return (
    <PageBreadcrumbsWrapper>
        {breadcrumbs.map(({ title, to }, index) => (
            <PageBreadcrumb
                key={to}
                linkComponent={PageBreadcrumbLink}
                title={title}
                path={to}
                isLast={index === breadcrumbs.length - 1}
            />
        ))}
    </PageBreadcrumbsWrapper>
);
```

## Props
